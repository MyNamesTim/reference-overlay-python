# Glass

A lightweight Python tool for overlaying an image on your screen at any position and scale. Useful for artists, designers, or developers who want to reference or compare images without switching windows.

## Features

- Load any image from your filesystem.
- Click anywhere on the screen to position the overlay.
- Scale the image up or down while preserving the aspect ratio.
- Always-on-top, borderless window for unobstructed reference.
- Cross-platform: works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Safeguards in case of a scaling error.

## Upcoming/Desired Features and Updates

* Click-through capability.
* Previews when hovering mouse cursor and waiting to set image position.
* Scaling slider/input UI with image preview/dimensions.
* More user-friendly UI, perhaps outside of ```cmd```.
* Allow photos to be switched without closing and reopening the program.
